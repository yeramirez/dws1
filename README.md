### Designing for Web Standards I

This class was focused on teaching us CSS and all of its possibilities. I learned a lot in this class and explored what can be made with our imagination. I personally liked this class because it's where I learned that I have an interest in designing. It was a great learning experience because I came out with so much more than expected.

_Please don't judge my stuff too hard, this was my first attempt ever at CSS-ing something and not let it just be black and white. Thank you._

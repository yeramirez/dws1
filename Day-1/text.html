		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>

			<p>The giant squid (genus: <em><strong>Architeuthis</strong></em>) is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <em><strong>Architeuthidae</strong></em>,
			represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size
			(see Deep-sea gigantism): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft)
			for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the colossal squid at
			an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long
			(more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft).
			Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>

			<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <strong><abbr title="Museum of Nature and Science">MNS</abbr></strong> of Tokyo, Japan and the
			<strong><abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr></strong> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat.
			Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The <strong>NMNS</strong> and <strong>OWA</strong> successfully filmed a live adult giant
			squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
